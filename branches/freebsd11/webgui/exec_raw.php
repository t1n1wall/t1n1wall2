	Note: for CSRF protection, this script cannot be called directly with a
	GET parameter anymore. You must first call the script (GET) without any parameters
	to obtain a current token, and then call it again (POST) while passing the token
	value as the parameter __csrf_magic.
	
	Minimal example in Perl:
	
	#!/usr/bin/perl

	use LWP::UserAgent;

	my $m0n0wall_ip = "192.168.1.1";
	my $m0n0wall_user = "admin";
	my $m0n0wall_pass = "mono";
	my $cmd = "dmesg";

	my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new;
	$ua->credentials("$m0n0wall_ip:80", ".", $m0n0wall_user, $m0n0wall_pass);

	# get new CSRF magic token
	my $res = $ua->get("http://$m0n0wall_ip/exec_raw.php");
	my $csrftoken = $res->content;

	# make a request to exec_raw.php
	$res = $ua->post("http://$m0n0wall_ip/exec_raw.php", {
		'__csrf_magic' => $csrftoken,
		'cmd' => $cmd
	});
	print $res->content;

critical areas

areas to investigate impact
	Check removing ifconfig patches ok , basically does dhcp-pd work ? (randr etc)
	Check rtadvd patch for logging is good, looks fine
	firewall tuneables are now sysctl's like net.inet.ipf.fr_udptimeout , we could make these user configurable
	amd64 kernel config has not been update for freebsd 10
	ipfw supports redirect for ipv6 now, captiveportal should be updated
 	ralink option should be removed from webgui as not a kmod anymore
 	runfw and acpi are not kmods anymore, they are built into the kernel

	syslinux build maybe reduced a fraction if not boot kmods are moved out of kernel into chroot for kldload after init/rc
	DHCP relay cannot start when DHCP server is running (even on different interfaces)
	
areas to improve
	wireless LAN country code selection ("ifconfig xxx list countries")
	revamp bridge support: use virtual interfaces, configured on Interfaces: Assign page (new tab
	syslinux build needs rework for symlinks not being supported on FAT32 (mac os supports symlinks on fat32 and there is a patch for linux)  .htpasswd, config.xml , etc/hosts and /etc/resolv.conf are broken.  It may be ok to just use them without the symlink	as modern flash drives can handle a lot of r/w before 'wearing out'
